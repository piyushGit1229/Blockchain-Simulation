<h1 align="center" id="title">Blockchain Simulation</h1>

<p id="description">The Blockchain Simulation project is designed to demonstrate how a blockchain works. It allows users to perform tasks like adding transactions mining blocks and checking the blockchain's validity. Key features include: Creating and adding transactions. Mining blocks and adding them to the blockchain. Checking wallet balances. Validating the blockchain's integrity. Interacting with smart contracts. The project helps users understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology in an easy-to-understand way.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Create Transactions: Users can create new transactions to add to the blockchain.
*   Mine Blocks: Blocks can be mined and added to the blockchain simulating a mining process.
*   Check Wallet Balances: Users can check their wallet balances which are linked to their blockchain addresses.
*   Blockchain Validation: The integrity of the blockchain can be verified to ensure there is no tampering or invalid data.
*   Smart Contracts Interaction: Users can interact with smart contracts for decentralized applications allowing for automated transactions and agreements.
*   Easy Setup: A script is provided to automatically set up the necessary databases (contracts.db and database.db) for smooth operation.
